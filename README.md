# Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem - MDVRP
## Code base - Python version

This repository is a codebase for the instances of the Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). When I started to work with this problem, several troubles were found from reading instance files to calculating objective function, and so on. I hope this codebase might help everyone to work with this VRP class.

You may find the main instance files [here](https://github.com/fboliveira/MDVRP-Instances).

## How to use

This codebase implements the following features:

- Read the instance problem from a file.
- Define a data structure to represent the solution.
- Calculate cost for the mono objective problem - the total distance traveled.

To use this codebase, you might make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) or download this repo, and implement your algorithm(s) to solve the problem.

Please **make your code, data, instructions, and everything else needed to run your project also available. This is mandatory in order to allow the [Reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility), and help other researchers**. ***Science will be grateful for!***
